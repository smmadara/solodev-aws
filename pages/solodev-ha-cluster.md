## Overview

## Prerequisites
The following is a list of prerequisites need to launch a stack. Please note that each of the following must be configured within the region you intend to launch the stack. If the following items are already created, you can skip to deploying.

* [VPC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/techcto-datacenter/aws/corp-vpc.yaml)
* [EC2 Key Pair](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#KeyPairs:sort=keyName)
* [SSL/TLS Certificates](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?#/privatewizard/)

## Steps to Run
To launch the entire stack and deploy on AWS, click on one of the ***Launch Stack*** links below or download the Master template and launch it locally.

| Parameter | Description |

| KeyName | (Prerequisite) The name of an existing EC@ KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instances. [Create a KeyPair](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#KeyPairs:sort=keyName) beforehand if you have not done so.|
| Subnets | Choose which subnets this ECS cluster should be deployed to.|
| VPC | (Prerequisite) Choose which VPC the Application Load Balancer should be deployed to. Create the VPC beforehand using [this configuration](https://s3.amazonaws.com/techcto-datacenter/aws/corp-vpc.yaml) if you have not done so. |
